      <div class="title">HOW DO WE TELL SCIENCE STORIES?</div>
      <p>One of the most effective ways to communicate science to the general 
        audience is through stories. Everyone loves them. In films, music, and 
        theaters, artists have long experimented on and perfected the crafts of 
        spreading ideas and emotions at the same time. Perhaps, we, scientists, 
        can master such art as well.</p>

      INTRODUCING CHARACTERS
      <br />
      <img src="Anastasia_musical.jpg" alt="Anastasia" width="95.5" 
        height="150" style="float: left; margin-top: 22px; margin-right: 22px"/>
      <p>Lehman Engel, a former Broadway director, walked on a beach. He saw a 
        dreary pelican flying, looking for fish. What a poor bird. But soon, it  
        dived and emerged with one in its mouth. Lehman thought, "There was no 
        doubt that I was on its side because I had met the pelican first." So, 
        what if he was snorkeling underwater, mesmerized by a beautiful blue 
        fish? And suddenly, the pelican struck. Oh no! &bull; Broadway musicals 
        like <i>Anastasia</i> typically present their main characters, and life 
        goals, early in the story. The audience then decides whom to root. 
        Their choices depend on the perspective given, which is framed by the 
        sequence and length of introduction. How could we benefit from Lehman's 
        inspiration? &bull; We tell stories about nature. Explaining 
        observations is not straightforward because there are always competing 
        hypotheses: the null and the alternatives. These are our characters. 
        Anyone has a chance of surviving hypothesis tests. However, the null, 
        maybe because of its simplicity and or dreariness, often lies in the 
        shadow of the alternatives. The lack of stage time can instill a sense 
        of failure when all the alternatives get falsified in the end. But, 
        what if we change our perspective at the beginning? We can satisfy the 
        audience by making their beloved character the winner.</p>
      <br />
      PLOTTING THE PIECES
      <br />
      <img src="Orient_Express.jpg" alt="Orient Express" width="150" 
        height="95" style="float: left; margin-top: 22px; margin-right: 24px"/>
      <p>What makes a murder-mystery novel like <i>Murder on the Orient 
        Express</i> so compelling that it grips readers to finish it in one or 
        two sittings? Why does Detective Hercule Poirot request each train 
        passenger whom he interviews to write their signatures? &bull; A murder 
        is simple. What makes it complicated is that we never learn about it 
        all at once. Building the puzzle, Agatha Christie chops her story into 
        matching pieces—a clue and an answer—and orders them into a neat 
        sequence. Confusions go to the beginning and resolutions to the end. 
        Readers won't be able to sleep until the puzzle is complete. &bull; The 
        manuscript outline fits this clue-answer system. More than a hook, the 
        introduction props the discussion. Readers become excited by collecting 
        clues and sensing looming awe, but all have to pay off at the end. Soil 
        scientist Joshua Schimel best presents this idea as a structure 
        familiar among journalists: the hourglass. The discussion on the 
        results and significance of a research project should match the 
        promise. Wouldn't we feel cheated if the conclusion springs from 
        nowhere? Or when it fails to close all loops? But if plotted well, the 
        intro and discussion couple makes for a satisfying ride.</p>
