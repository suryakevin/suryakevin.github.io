      FOSSIL RECORD BIAS IN MACROEVOLUTIONARY ANALYSES
      <br />
      <img src="Surya_figure2.svg" alt="tetrapodomorph water-land transition"/>
      <p>Fossil record bias confounds analyses of species dispersal through 
        space and time. Circa 400 million years ago, fish-like ancestors of 
        tetrapods, four-limbed vertebrates, moved from water to land. Using 
        this transition as a case study,  Jacob Gardner, Chris Organ, and I 
        propose a proxy for fossil sampling bias that incorporates geographic 
        information. We initially found that the water-land transition occurred 
        in Euramerica and that cross-continent dispersals tend to be rapid. 
        However, these results are unreliable because they can be explained by 
        insufficient fossil record in all regions except Southern 
        Euramerica.</p>

      <b>BIRD TAIL DEVELOPMENT AND EVOLUTION</b>
      <br />
      <img src="Surya_figure1.svg" alt="dinosaur tails" />
      <p><i>Pygostyle</i>. The long tail of Mesozoic dinosaurs rapidly evolved 
        into the short, terminally-fused tail of living birds. Two fossil 
        specimens (<i>Zhongornis haoae</i> and the dinosaur tail preserved in 
        Burmese amber) exhibit a transitional tail morphology: short and 
        unfused. However, our study on bird tail development warrants 
        re-interpretation of these transitional species. Bird tail vertebrae 
        change radically with growth. As birds reach maturity, the last four to 
        six vertebrae fuse into a compound bone called the pygostyle. Vertebral 
        side projections mineralize long after hatching. <i>Zhongornis</i>, as 
        a juvenile, might not have yet formed a pygostyle, and the dinosaur 
        tail, also immature, might be avian.</p>
      <p><i>Spinal Nerve</i>. Ground-dwelling birds like the emu and kiwi 
        (paleognaths) have holes in their pygostyles. These holes are absent in 
        other birds' pygostyles (chicken, Chinese quail, and rock dove) or the 
        tail vertebrae of the brown anole and American alligator (close living 
        relatives of birds). What is the purpose of the holes? My colleagues 
        and I study the tail development in the species above and found that 
        the paleognath spinal nerves uniquely extend to the very end of the 
        tail. The holes seem to serve as exit points for these nerves. Looking 
        back through time, we find that these holes also exist in the Mesozoic 
        confuciusornithids, extinct relatives of modern birds, indicating an 
        ancient origin. The paleognath unique nerve configuration, combined 
        with other evidence such as the likely independent gain of pygostyle in 
        the extinct bird <i>Fukuipteryx prima</i>, spitballs yet untested 
        speculation: Living birds arose from more than one long-tailed 
        ancestors.</p>
      <br />
      NOVEL CORONAVIRUS
      <br />
      <p><i>Wastewater</i>. Researchers have recently detected SARS-CoV-2 in 
        feces, which means that we may be able to use wastewater to monitor 
        viral prevalence. We sampled SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater (Bozeman, 
        Montana, USA) over 17 days, and sequenced segments of the genomes to 
        infer viral ancestry. Viral RNA has steadily decreased over the last 
        week, suggesting that state-mandated social isolation is effective in 
        containing the outbreak.</p>

      GENOTYPE-PHENOTYPE ASSOCIATION
      <br />
      <p>Phylogenetic trees with branch lengths scaled to the amount of 
        molecular evolution (substitution) explain trait data better than those 
        to time. Molecular evolution matches trait evolution. For comparative 
        studies, researchers should use molecular branch lengths whenever 
        possible.</p>

       BIRD PRELAYING EGG ROTATION
      <br />
      <p>Eggs are known to rotate 180° <i>in utero</i> around the short axis in 
        chickens and six other bird species. Egg rotation may have evolved in 
        association with the separation of the pubic bones, which appeared at 
        least 95 million years ago. <i>In utero</i> egg rotation may occur in 
        all birds and select for a wide pelvic canal in the females, as a 
        narrow one could cause complication. Using a comparative approach, we 
        find no evidence for universal rotation across birds, assuming it 
        shapes pelvic morphology.</p>
