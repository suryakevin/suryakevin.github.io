<h1>KEVIN SURYA</h1>
<p>Iâ€™m an Indonesian undergraduate at Montana State University. My interest revolves around the dinosaur-bird transition and macroevolutionary modeling. Dana Rashid and I are studying chicken tail development to unravel tail shortening and fusion in the avian lineage. David Varricchio, Chris Organ, and I are investigating how prelaying egg rotation shaped avian pelvic evolution. And, Chris Organ and I are testing which type of phylogenetic branch length unit better explains variation in species' traits: Time or genetic substitution?</p>
